This is the versioning page for collaboration on the `Highline-Rescue-Project`. 

After a successful rescue training of a patient off a highline developed by Lukas Irmler, Aaron Benkert and Jakob Bludau in collaboration with Heli Austria.  The results of the ~30 flown longline rescue trainings  were presented at ICAR 2023. This started this project as a discussion with panel members that were interested in transfering the procedure to a hoist based rescue. The Bergwacht Bayern, and the authors agreed to collaborate with the German Police to investigate the contact of highine and hoist cable. This is targeted to form a starting point for discussing if a highline resuce can be performed with a hoist equipped helicopter. The main concern is the cutting load the ~4mm hoist cable can present to the highline.

This repository will also host the documents that were created before the start of this project. These documents are currently in translation. Only english versions will be hosted here.
