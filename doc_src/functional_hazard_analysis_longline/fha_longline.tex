\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
A Highline rescue is similar to one of a lead climber, a highly technical rescue. Furthermore, the patient is prone to suspension trauma due to long periods of hanging in a harness. Therefore, time is a priority.
Highlines span gaps, ridges, etc. Often, the anchors are only reachable by rappel/climbing. Thus, even if a terrestrial rescue transports the patient to one of the anchors, the way to a hospital is still long. Furthermore, the mode of transport to the hospital is probably a helicopter due to the terrain.\\

With longer Highlines, the rescue is escalating in complexity. Ropes need to be longer, and direct rappel off the Highline is no longer possible or dangerous (stretch in “static” ropes and webbings is not negligible and leads to large vertical movement during rappel). Furthermore, rescuers need to pull the patient up for a rescue towards one of the anchors due to the Highline sag. \\

These thoughts lead the authors to start a discussion with Heli Austria (namely Gabriel Falkner) on a helicopter-based rescue directly off the Highline. A literature review showed that there is little published experience on this topic.\\

This document contains the thoughts of the authors on a helicopter-based highline rescue. The document shows the stages of procedure in section \ref{sec:proc}, based on the procedure for an injured lead climber. Section \ref{sec:conventional} describes the conventional setup of a Highline. From this, the authors derived a functional hazard analysis of the rescue procedure in section \ref{sec:fha}. Section \ref{sec:fha} also contains measures of mitigation for the most critical risks. Section \ref{sec:modified} describes the resulting Highline setup for a safer training. Finally, section \ref{sec:result} lists the procedure and the personal protective equipment in detail. The overall focus is on safety.

This document is targeted on a rescue with a longline as connection between rescuer and helicopter. For hoist operations
